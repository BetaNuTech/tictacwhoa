## How to Play

In Tic-Tac-Whoa!, you play Tic Tac Toe on a 3x3 grid of nine smaller Tic Tac Toe boards. To win, you need to conquer three smaller boards in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Each move you make dictates the board your opponent must play on next. Choose your moves wisely to outsmart your opponent and claim victory!

Once you’ve mastered two dimensions, try playing single cube 3-D tic tac toe.  This will help you think in three dimensions, preparing you to tackle the most challenging tic tac toe variation yet.  Now you’ll play in a 3x3x3 array of 27 tic tac toe cubes!!
